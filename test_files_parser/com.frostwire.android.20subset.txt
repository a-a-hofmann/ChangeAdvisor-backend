So easy a caveman can do it!
It's good
This app honestly made me uninstall. But the new APK is a masterpiece. The search works now! On top of it. YouTube compatibility. My only complaint is that I'd like to organize things more, remove or add album pics, rearrange things, etc. But I'm not going to bump this great app to a 4 because of a acceptable thing. Keep up with the great work!
I went on the website to download frostwire plus but  now I get less results than when I used this so called basic
Deleted my songs
I can find any song I am looking for! And I can use PowerAmp to listen to my music, instead of the native app.
Great app. Thank you ALL so much.
Once you get the update it shows so much more options
I loved it. It had everything I searched and fast. This Is a great app should download
Gives me all I need.
I can find almost anything I want here!
It is the best music downloader of all the ones that i used .
When I click on movie then download and go to transfers it is not there
I can't download anything from YouTube even though I copied and pasted the proper links
Nice app
I find whatever I need hella fast and reliable. Better than LimeWire ever was. Files never have any type of malware attached, and you can find very high quality stuff easily. Keep up the good work. And the other users - They couldn't run a file sharing service for the life of them. They are complaining about things they clearly know nothing about. But keep up the good work FrostWire. I'm currently using Plus.
Best music downloader around, love it.
Everytime I download songs and go to my song library it has also downloaded a bunch of random songs related to the music I actually meant to download... Pretty annoying to be honest
It said download in background but didn't download I at all
Installed new apk... Worked for a few weeks. Now it doesn't again.
